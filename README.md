## Installation

To use this application, navigate to the deployed Heroku [site](https://rocky-taiga-17481.herokuapp.com/).

_To install this application locally yourself, download and clone the files from this repository. Run 'npm run install' to install the packages in the package.jsons, 'npm run build' to create a build, and 'npm run develop' to start the application in your local browser._

## Usage

If you use the application through the deployed [Heroku site](https://rocky-taiga-17481.herokuapp.com/), simply navigate to and interact with the site from there. Sign up and log in before searching books on the Search for Books page. Save books and view them on the See Your Books page.

_If the program was cloned, downloaded, and installed instead, get the application running by typing "npm run develop" into the command-line. All features of the application are then accessible through localhost on your browser or other applications._
